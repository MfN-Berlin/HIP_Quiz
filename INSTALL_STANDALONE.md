## Installing the quiz as an offline application
These are the instructions for installing the quiz as an offline application. During installation, you might need connectivity.

1. Make sure Firefox version 79 or higher is installed. If Firefox is installed, check the installed version by opening the menu item `Help -> About Firefox`. If Firefox is not installed, get it at https://www.mozilla.org/
2. Open Firefox. Type `about:config` in the URL bar. Accept the warranty legal slur (if you didn't pay for Firefox, you don't have a warranty anyway).
3. In the search box, type `privacy.file_unique_origin`. Change the value to `false` by double-clicking on it. This will allow Firefox to open local files. You can close Firefox.
4. Get the quiz.zip file from and unpack it anywhere on your system, for example on your desktop.

## Running the quiz as an offline application
After the quiz archive has been unpacked, you can run it without network connectivity.

**Linux**: On the command line, cd to the folder where you unpacked the quiz archive and run `./quiz`.

**Windows**: Run the file "quiz" using Firefox, either by double-clicking on it if Firefox is your default browser, or open Firefox and choose "File->Open File" (Alt key shows the menu).

Click `F11` to toggle fullscreen mode. Adjust the size using the `Strg+`, `Strg-` and `Strg0` keys.

## Setting the quiz to launch on startup
Once the quiz is installed and configured, it is possible to launch the quiz in fullscreen mode when the machine starts up. Instructions vary depending on your operating system.
